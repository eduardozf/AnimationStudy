## About the Project

While researching design references for websites, such as Awwwards, I came across some concepts that I wanted to incorporate into my portfolio. Many of these concepts around the theme of space, which personally captivates me. Given the vast nature of space (depending on one's perspective), I saw an opportunity to create a conceptual website that integrates animations to grab the user's attention.

It's worth noting that although I'm a programmer, not a designer, I'm eager to apply some animation concepts using JavaScript and CSS. While I acknowledge there's room for improvement in terms of UI and UX, I'm excited to explore the animation possibilities in this project.

## Why Didn't I Use Libraries Like Next.js or Tailwind?

Early in my career, I always aimed to use the best available tools, regardless of project size. While this approach often made coding more satisfying, I found it sometimes introduced unnecessary complexity in projects that should have been straightforward. For this particular project, I chose not to implement a library as it wouldn't significantly enhance agility. This is a conceptual project focused on animations in JavaScript, and part of the programming maturity I've been developing is understanding not only what tools are available but also when and how to apply them.
